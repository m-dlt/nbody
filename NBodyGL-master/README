V 1.5
-----

This program creates a solar system and uses Newton's Law of gravitation to 
animate motion. It allows the user to manipulate and explore the system at will.

Requires:
---------

	*	OpenGL - a graphics library
		-	http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/
		
	*	numpy - a math library
		-	http://www.numpy.org/
		
	*	PIL - python imaging library
		-   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
		
Usage:
------

	*	Run the NBodyV_1_5.py file
	
	*	Collisions are still not working correctly. If you have problems, I would suggest turning them off through
		the command line
		
	*	Command Line Flags:
			
			-	The first flag is the number of planets
			
			-	The second flag is the number of rings (these determine th boundaries
				and the spawn radius for planets)
				
			-	'-c' means no collisions
			
			-	'-d' means no deletions at boundaries
			
			-	'-e' means more eccentric orbits
			
			-   '-b' means binary star system
			
			-   '-t' means spheres are replaced with teapots
			
	
Features:
---------

	*	Gravitation between multiple Astronomical objects
	
	*	Adding and subtracting objects from the system
	
	*	Scene traversal with keyboard input
	
	*	Scene traversal with mouse input
	
	*	Collisions with debris
	
Future Features:
----------------
		
	*	More variation in mass and density
	
	*	Better collisions (fix disappearing sun and conserve energy)
	
	*	Generation of high speed, high mass external Astronomical objects
	
	*	N number of stars
	
	*	Heliocentric lighting
	
	*	Bugfixes for movement
	
	*	Atmosphere graphical effects
	
	*	Shaders for the sun
	
Controls:
---------

	*	w: move forward
	
	*	s: move backward
	
	*	a: turn left
	
	*	d: turn right
	
	*	e: turn up
	
	*	q: turn down
	
	*	p: pause/play
	
	*	i: rotate camera up
	
	*	k: rotate camera down
	
	*	j: rotate camera left
	
	*	l: rotate camera right
	
	*	]: add Astronomical object
	
	*	[: remove Astronomical object
	
	*	mouse: changes camera facing
	
	*	left click: move forward
	
	*	right click: move backward
	
	*	middle click: stop moving forward or backward
